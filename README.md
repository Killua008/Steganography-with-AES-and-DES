# Steganography-with-AES-and-DES
Steganography is a method of hiding a text in a image,audio or video files.
To add up to the level of security of the hidden data the text is encrypted using Cryptography
Algorithm like AES and DES are known for their dependence since decades
AES is 128 bits block chiper whereas DES is a 64 bits block chiper.
Both are Symmetric Ciphers
We encrypt Files using both the Algorithm
