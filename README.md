# Steganography-with-AES-and-DES
Steganography is a method of hiding a text in a image,audio or video files.
To add up to the level of security of the hidden data the text is encrypted using Cryptography.
Algorithm like AES and DES are known for their dependence since decades.
AES is 128 bits block chiper whereas DES is a 64 bits block chiper.
Both are Symmetric Ciphers.
We can encrypt Files using both the Algorithm.
In this Project were are AES encryption for File encryption.
